# CodeSplain

Want to learn how to combine React 19 and AI LLMs to build something truly useful? In this tutorial, we’ll create an AI-powered Code Explainer App from scratch.

Check out the source code and start running.

## Learn to build the app

We’ll design the app, configure an Express.js backend, set up a REST endpoint that talks to an LLM, and then integrate everything into a modern React 19 app (with Vite + TailwindCSS).

This isn’t just theory — by the end, you’ll have a working AI Code Explainer tool that takes any code snippet and returns clear, beginner-friendly explanations. Along the way, you’ll also learn about React 19’s new features like useActionState and Server Actions, plus best practices for API integration and error handling.

Whether you’re a React developer curious about AI integration or someone looking for a hands-on full-stack project, this step-by-step guide will walk you through everything.

We’ll cover:

- ✅ How to design and plan an AI project
- ✅ Configuring Express.js for REST APIs
- ✅ Connecting to an LLM for code explanation
- ✅ Testing APIs with Postman
- ✅ Building a modern frontend with React 19, Vite, and TailwindCSS
- ✅ Using React 19’s useActionState + Server Actions in real projects
- ✅ Handling API responses and formatting output
